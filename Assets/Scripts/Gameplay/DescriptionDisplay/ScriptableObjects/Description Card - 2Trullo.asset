    DisplayDescriptions: " The trullo pinnacle is a distinctive cone-shaped roof
      structure found on traditional trullo houses in the Apulia region of Italy.
      It serves both a functional and aesthetic purpose, providing ventilation and
      stability to the trullo's roof while also contributing to its iconic appearance.
      The pinnacle's conical shape helps to funnel rainwater away from the roof,
      preventing water damage and ensuring the durability of the structure.\r"

    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 56104303961073e4a838ad046663e2b3, type: 3}

    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: Chiancarelle are flat, limestone slabs used to construct
      the walls and roofs of trullo houses. These stones are carefully stacked and
      arranged in a circular or dome-shaped pattern, without the use of mortar or
      cement, to create the characteristic conical shape of the trullo. Chiancarelle
      provide excellent insulation against heat and cold, helping to regulate the
      temperature inside the trullo and maintain a comfortable living environment
      for its occupants.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Cannella Stone:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: eaff1c39d1ca8634f83b5e041ac36abc, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 5.86, y: 2.860005, z: 8.5}
    CameraRotation: {x: 6.395, y: -67.964, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: Cannella stone, also known as tufa or calcareous limestone,
      is the primary building material used in the construction of trullo houses.
      This locally sourced stone is abundant in the Apulia region and prized for
      its durability, workability, and thermal properties. Cannella stone is carefully
      cut and shaped into uniform blocks or slabs, then stacked and arranged to form
      the walls, roofs, and other structural elements of the trullo. Its natural
      beauty and warm, earthy tones contribute to the timeless charm and rustic elegance
      of trullo architecture.
