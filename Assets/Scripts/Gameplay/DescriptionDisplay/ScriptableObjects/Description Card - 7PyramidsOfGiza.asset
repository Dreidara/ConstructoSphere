  - DisplayTitle: 'Subterranean Chamber:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: cec2f8a130cf0084db0203d101e03b91, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: The subterranean chamber, accessed via a descending passageway
      from the northern side, is a large underground cavity. Its exact purpose remains
      uncertain, but it may have served as a burial chamber or part of the pyramid's
      construction process, possibly functioning as a foundation or offering space.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Stone Casing Limestone:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: a6e24d29e9015ab43b6ea2a7dcf93d1c, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: The finely cut limestone blocks formed the outer layer of
      the pyramid, originally polished to a smooth, reflective surface. These casing
      stones protected the inner core and provided a uniform surface, enhancing the
      pyramid's appearance and possibly symbolizing the pharaoh's connection to the
      sun god Ra.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Relieving Chamber:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 46876801b1f588040854dadd6e1eba25, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: Small chambers located above the King's Chamber, the relieving
      chambers were positioned to relieve pressure on the chamber's ceiling. They
      distributed the weight of the overlying masonry, preventing collapse and ensuring
      the stability of the pyramid's inner structure.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Queen''s Chamber:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: e548084f946b1e8429cb6140adbbe067, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: Situated within the pyramid's structure, the Queen's Chamber
      served a ceremonial or symbolic purpose. Its exact function remains uncertain,
      but it may have been intended for ritual activities, storage, or as a secondary
      burial chamber.

    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: Near the top of the Great Pyramid, the King's Chamber served
      as the primary burial chamber for Pharaoh Khufu. Its grandeur and significance
      reflect the pharaoh's divine status and eternal journey into the afterlife.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Inner Chamber:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 89d4ea8ff5d8605488bbdac1fa089459, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: Collectively comprising the King's Chamber, Queen's Chamber,
      and associated passageways, the inner chamber complex housed the main funerary
      and ceremonial spaces within the pyramid. These chambers played a central role
      in the pharaoh's burial rites and spiritual journey.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Grand Gallery:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: df4112b6738157140ab748763908abe8, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: The Grand Gallery, featuring a steeply inclined corbelled
      ceiling, served as a ceremonial passageway leading to the King's Chamber. Its
      architectural grandeur and symbolic ascent may have facilitated ritual processions
      and spiritual transitions during the pharaoh's burial ceremonies.
