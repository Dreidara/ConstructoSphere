  - DisplayTitle: 'Tipi Smoke Flaps:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 3f53587b56c5ec14e887c68f1cf92d9d, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0, y: 5.3, z: 5.3}
    CameraRotation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: The tipi smoke flaps are adjustable openings located at
      the top of the tipi cover, near the peak. They serve the essential purpose
      of regulating airflow and ventilation within the tipi while also allowing smoke
      from the central firepit to escape. By adjusting the position of the smoke
      flaps, occupants can control the airflow to maintain a comfortable indoor environment
      and prevent smoke buildup.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Tipi Poles:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 11156f6a8cdcf484a8380d27fde5d9ba, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0.08, y: 6.6731, z: 8.051033}
    CameraRotation: {x: 25.131, y: 3.885, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: Tipi poles are long, slender wooden poles used to support
      the structure and shape of the tipi. They are typically made from sturdy, lightweight
      wood such as cedar or pine and are arranged in a circular formation around
      the perimeter of the tipi cover. The poles provide structural stability and
      strength to the tipi, while also allowing for easy assembly and disassembly
      when moving or transporting the structure.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Tipi Liner:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 965675cb850ea7c4f82a06fdc4bb6b80, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: -2.5, y: 2.47, z: 9.3}
    CameraRotation: {x: 29.256, y: 85.532, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: The tipi liner is a fabric lining that hangs vertically
      along the interior walls of the tipi, extending from the ground to the top.
      It serves multiple purposes, including insulation, moisture control, and aesthetic
      enhancement. The liner helps to trap heat inside the tipi during cold weather,
      while also preventing condensation and moisture buildup. Additionally, the
      liner can be decorated with traditional designs or patterns, adding to the
      visual appeal of the tipi's interior.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Tipi Lacing Pins:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: aebf7cc945264f3479904e30bdff33d8, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 0.05, y: 1.89104, z: 8.1486}
    CameraRotation: {x: 50, y: 0.963, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: Tipi lacing pins are wooden or metal stakes used to secure
      the tipi cover to the ground and hold it in place. They are inserted through
      loops or tabs along the bottom edge of the tipi cover and driven into the ground
      to anchor the structure. Lacing pins provide stability and security, preventing
      the tipi cover from shifting or blowing away in strong winds or inclement weather.
  - DisplayTitle: 'Tipi Door:'
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: e3bd0f063dcabfc478bd9e7c8c3e3811, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: 1.252654, y: 2.451737, z: 6.672646}
    CameraRotation: {x: 15.161, y: 7.151, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: The tipi door is a flap or opening located at the front
      of the tipi, providing access to the interior. It can be rolled up or tied
      open during the day for ventilation and ease of entry, and secured closed at
      night for privacy and protection from the elements. The door also serves as
      a symbolic entry point, welcoming visitors into the tipi and maintaining a
      connection with the surrounding Tipi Cover:.
  - DisplayTitle: Tipi Cover
    DisplaySprite: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 4a13179a7927dd14d83f23e109f1aa1a, type: 3}
    CameraPosition: {x: -1, y: 4.795014, z: 9.3}
    CameraRotation: {x: 19.974, y: 75.562, z: 0}
    DisplayDescriptions: The tipi cover is a large, cone-shaped fabric covering that
      forms the outer shell of the tipi. It is typically made from durable, weather-resistant
      materials such as canvas or buffalo hide and is stretched over the tipi poles
      to create a snug, waterproof shelter. The tipi cover provides protection from
      rain, wind, and sun, while also allowing for natural light and ventilation
      through the smoke flaps and door.
